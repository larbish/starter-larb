Collections in Nuxt Content are a powerful way to organize and manage your content. They allow you to group related content items together, making it easier to query, display, and maintain your site's content.


## What are Content Collections?

Content Collections are groups of related content items within your Nuxt Content project. They provide a structured way to organize and manage your content, making it easier to work with large amounts of data.

Key features of Content Collections include:

1. **Logical Grouping**: Collections allow you to group similar content together, such as blog posts, product pages, or documentation articles.

2. **Shared Configuration**: You can apply common settings and validations to all items within a collection, ensuring consistency across your content.

3. **Improved Querying**: Collections make it easier to fetch and filter related content items, enhancing the performance and flexibility of your content queries.

4. **Automatic Type Inference**: Nuxt Content can automatically infer the structure of your content, providing type safety and autocompletion in your development environment.

5. **Flexible Structure**: Collections can be organized in various ways, such as by content type, category, or any other logical grouping that suits your project's needs.

## Defining Collections

To define a custom collection, create `content.config.ts` file in ptoject's root directory. This is a special file that Nuxt Content will load and use to configure collections database, utility types and finding/parsing/querying contents.

Here's a simple example of how to define collections in your `content.config.ts` file:

```ts [content.config.ts]
import { defineCollection } from '@nuxt/content'

// Export collections
export const collections = {
  // Define collection using `defineCollection` utility
  docs: defineCollection({
    // Define the source directory for the collection
    // `source: '**'` will load every file inside `content` directory 
    source: '**',
    // Specify the type of content in this collection
    type: 'page'
  })
}
```

### Collection Schema

Schema is and important part of each collection. Schemas enforce consistent  data within a collection. Schemas also are grounf truth of Typescript typings for collections.

To define schema for you collection, go to `content.config.ts` and provide `schema` for your collection in `defineCollection` function.

```ts [content.config.ts]
import { defineCollection, z } from '@nuxt/content'

// Export collections
export const collections = {
  // Define collection using `defineCollection` utility
  docs: defineCollection({
    // Define the source directory for the collection
    // `source: '**'` will load every file inside `content` directory 
    source: '**',
    // Specify the type of content in this collection
    type: 'page',
    // Define custom schema for docs collection
    schema: z.object({ // Schema root should be an object!!
      tags: z.array(z.string()),
      image: z.string(),
      date: z.Date()
    })
  })
}
```


### Multiple collections

Defining multiple collections is as easy as creating one.


```ts [content.config.ts]
import { defineCollection, z } from '@nuxt/content'

// Export collections
export const collections = {
  // Define collection using `defineCollection` utility
  blog: defineCollection({
    // Define the source directory for the collection
    // `source: 'blog/**'` will load every file inside `content/blog` directory 
    source: 'blog/**',
    // Specify the type of content in this collection
    type: 'page'
  }),
  docs: defineCollection({
    // Define the source directory for the collection
    // `source: 'docs/**'` will load every file inside `content/docs` directory 
    source: 'docs/**',
    // Specify the type of content in this collection
    type: 'page'
  })
}
```

## Querying Collections

Nuxt Content provides `queryCollection` utility to query a collection and fetch on or all contents.

```ts
const docs = await queryCollection('docs').all()
```
