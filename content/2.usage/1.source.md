Nuxt Content processes file paths to extract useful information, enhancing the overall user experience by making content more accessible and organized.

## Paths


Nuxt Content uses generate a url friendly path for each content in the page collection. This path can be used in website URL to have 1-to-1 mapping with a content.
Here is some examples of generated path for different files.

| File                             | Internal path         |
| -------------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| `content/index.md`               | `/`                   |
| `content/about.md`               | `/about`              |
| `content/blog/index.md`          | `/blog`               |
| `content/blog/hello.md`          | `/blog/hello`         |
| `content/1.guide/2.installation` | `/guide/installation` |


There is a special helper in [`queryCollection('COLLECTION').path('PATH')`{lang=ts}](/composables/query-collection) to find content with a special path.


## Ordering

Add numeric prefixes to files and directories to specify an order. Nuxt Content uses these numbers to order content lists.

``` [Directory structure]
content/
  1.frameworks/
    1.vue.md
    2.nuxt.md
  2.examples/
    1.vercel.md
    2.netlify.md
    3.heroku.md
    index.md
```

::callout
Separate number from file name using `.` character. Using any other separator will not work.
