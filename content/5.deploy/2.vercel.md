Nuxt Content uses Nuxt deployment presets to adjust the build process for different hosting platforms. To deploy your Nuxt Content to Vercel, you can use the `vercel`{lang="ts-type"} preset.

Note that you need to change project configuration to deploy on Vercel. Nuxt and Nuxt Content automatically detect the vercel environment and adjust build configuration for you.

You can either use [Vercel git integration][1] or [Vercel CLI][2].
